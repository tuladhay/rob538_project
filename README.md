# Autonomous Agents Rob 538
The orginal code for MADDPG is from https://github.com/shariqiqbal2810/maddpg-pytorch.
It requires a modified Multiagent Particle Environment (see our other repo: MPE_modified), and Baselines repo from OpenAI which I have kindly included in this repo (but maybe not a good practice).

See RNN6 branch
